# problems-with-css
The problems I have with CSS, and what the solutions are

# No variables
Can't do:
```
background-color: same-as-everywhere-else;
```
because can't define `same-as-everywhere-else` with a value, like `teal`.

# Can't centre in React
What centres in plain HTML:
```
display: flex;
align-items: center;
justify-content: center;
```
doesn't in React.
